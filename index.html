                <h2>Interactive Arts and Technology Major</h2>
                <p>I am passionate about interaction and UX design with a strong interest in how research and science-based approaches can shape digital experiences. I love working with diverse stakeholders to make magic happen. I am also curious about the role of AI in creating innovative solutions and am interested in its ethics and societal impacts. When I'm not embarking on a technology-related adventure, I can be found exploring the outdoors, new music, and good eats.</p>
